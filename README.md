# The Project
Investigating a Kaggle dataset with Nobel Laureates from the past 100 years.

The Nobel Prize is arguably the most recognisable scientific honour in the world. It is awarded annually to scientists and scholars in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901, and while it was initially Eurocentric and Male-focused, it is now completely biased-Free. Surely, you say?

Let's find out, then! What traits do the prize winners possess? Which country receives it most frequently? Has anyone received it twice?

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.
